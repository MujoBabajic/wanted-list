# FBI Wanted List App

This is a very basic React app created for learning purposes.
It uses FBI's API to get the data of current wanted fugitives.

## How to run the app

After cloning the repository, make sure you are in the root directory of the app. Then run this code to install all dependencies:

### `npm install`

And after that run:

### `npm start`

The page will automatically open in your default browser. If not, then simply go to 'http://localhost:3000' in your search bar.
